For use with the GeoIP module and GeoLite database.  See GeoIP module INSTALL.txt file for more details

Installation:
*Turn module on and go to the admin/settings/geoip/redirect.
*Type the URL you want to redirect to and select the countries that should redirect to this address.  

This redirect is for annonymous traffic that doesn't access the /user page.  This way if you are working in a country that is on the redirect list you'll still be able to work on it :)
